# GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1. What is a GRU?
A GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to solve the vanishing gradient problem and improve learning for sequential data by using gating mechanisms (update and reset gates).

---

### Q2. How is GRU different from a vanilla RNN?
Unlike vanilla RNNs, GRUs use gating mechanisms (update and reset gates) to control information flow, which helps them retain long-term dependencies and avoid vanishing gradients.

---

### Q3. What are the main gates in GRU?
GRU has two gates:
- **Update gate (z)**: controls how much past information to carry forward.
- **Reset gate (r)**: decides how much past information to forget.

---

### Q4. How is GRU different from LSTM?
- LSTM has 3 gates (input, forget, output), GRU has 2 (update, reset).
- GRU combines hidden and cell states into one, LSTM maintains both.
- GRUs are computationally cheaper, while LSTMs can model more complex dependencies.

---

### Q5. What is the update gate in GRU?
The update gate controls the extent to which the previous hidden state is carried over to the current hidden state, balancing new information vs. past memory.

---

### Q6. What is the reset gate in GRU?
The reset gate determines how much of the past information to forget when computing the new candidate hidden state.

---

### Q7. Write the mathematical equations for GRU.
- Update gate:  
  \( z_t = \sigma(W_z \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \)  
- Reset gate:  
  \( r_t = \sigma(W_r \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t]) \)  
- Candidate state:  
  \( \tilde{h}_t = \tanh(W \cdot [r_t * h_{t-1}, x_t]) \)  
- Final state:  
  \( h_t = (1 - z_t) * h_{t-1} + z_t * \tilde{h}_t \)

---

### Q8. What problem do GRUs solve?
GRUs address the vanishing gradient problem and enable better learning of long-term dependencies in sequential data.

---

### Q9. Why are GRUs faster than LSTMs?
GRUs have fewer gates and parameters (no separate cell state), making them faster to train and less memory-intensive.

---

### Q10. Can GRUs handle variable-length sequences?
Yes, GRUs process sequences step by step and can naturally handle variable-length sequences.

---

### Q11. In what tasks do GRUs perform well?
GRUs perform well in speech recognition, time-series forecasting, sentiment analysis, and language modeling where sequence lengths are moderate.

---

### Q12. How does GRU mitigate vanishing gradients?
The update gate allows gradients to pass more directly through time, reducing vanishing effects.

---

### Q13. Do GRUs suffer from exploding gradients?
Yes, like other RNNs, GRUs can suffer from exploding gradients. Gradient clipping is often used to mitigate this.

---

### Q14. How does GRU compare with simple RNN in terms of training time?
Although each GRU unit is more complex, GRUs often converge faster due to better learning of long-term dependencies.

---

### Q15. Why are GRUs sometimes preferred over LSTMs?
- They’re faster and simpler.
- They perform similarly to LSTMs in many tasks.
- Require fewer parameters, making them good for smaller datasets.

---

### Q16. What is the role of the tanh activation in GRUs?
The tanh activation squashes the candidate hidden state values between -1 and 1, helping regulate learning.

---

### Q17. What is the role of the sigmoid activation in GRUs?
Sigmoid is used for gates (reset, update) to produce values between 0 and 1, which act as soft switches.

---

### Q18. What happens when the update gate is set to 0?
The GRU completely relies on the past hidden state and ignores new information.

---

### Q19. What happens when the update gate is set to 1?
The GRU fully updates its hidden state with the candidate hidden state, ignoring the past.

---

### Q20. What happens when the reset gate is set to 0?
The GRU forgets the previous hidden state completely when calculating the candidate hidden state.

---

### Q21. What happens when the reset gate is set to 1?
The GRU considers the entire previous hidden state while computing the candidate hidden state.

---

### Q22. Can GRUs overfit?
Yes, GRUs can overfit, especially on small datasets. Regularization (dropout, weight decay) helps.

---

### Q23. What is the memory requirement of GRUs compared to LSTMs?

Do you want me to move on to the **next topic (most likely RBM, but you said we removed it, so the next is GAN which you already marked as done → then Transformers → done → UMAP/TSNE skipped → LSTM done → GRU done → next should be Autoencoders (already done), so the upcoming one would be **Reinforcement Learning (RL basics)**)?
