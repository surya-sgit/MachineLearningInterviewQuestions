# Random Forest – 100 Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1. What is a Random Forest?  
**A:** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their predictions using majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression). It reduces overfitting and improves generalization compared to a single decision tree.

---

### Q2. How does Random Forest work?  
**A:** Random Forest creates multiple bootstrapped datasets from the original data, trains a decision tree on each, and aggregates their outputs. It also introduces randomness by selecting a random subset of features at each split.

---

### Q3. Why is Random Forest better than a single decision tree?  
**A:** A single tree tends to overfit, while Random Forest reduces variance by averaging predictions from many trees, leading to better accuracy and stability.

---

### Q4. What is bagging in Random Forest?  
**A:** Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is the process of training each tree on a random sample (with replacement) of the data and then averaging/voting across trees.

---

### Q5. What is feature randomness in Random Forest?  
**A:** At each split, Random Forest selects a random subset of features instead of all features. This introduces diversity among trees and improves performance.

---

### Q6. How are predictions made in Random Forest?  
**A:**  
- **Classification:** Each tree votes for a class; the majority class is chosen.  
- **Regression:** Predictions are averaged across all trees.

---

### Q7. What are the main hyperparameters of Random Forest?  
**A:**  
- `n_estimators`: number of trees  
- `max_depth`: maximum depth of trees  
- `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf`  
- `max_features`: number of features to consider per split  
- `bootstrap`: whether sampling is with replacement  

---

### Q8. What is out-of-bag (OOB) error in Random Forest?  
**A:** OOB error is the validation error computed using data not included in a tree’s bootstrap sample. It provides an unbiased estimate of model accuracy without needing a separate validation set.

---

### Q9. What is the difference between bagging and Random Forest?  
**A:** Bagging trains trees on bootstrapped datasets but uses all features for splitting. Random Forest extends bagging by adding feature randomness at each split.

---

### Q10. How does Random Forest reduce overfitting?  
**A:** By averaging across many diverse trees, Random Forest reduces variance, making the model less sensitive to noise and preventing overfitting.

---

### Q11. What is the role of `n_estimators`?  
**A:** It determines the number of trees in the forest. More trees usually improve accuracy but increase computation time.

---

### Q12. What is the role of `max_features`?  
**A:** It controls how many features are considered at each split. Smaller values increase diversity among trees but may reduce individual tree accuracy.

---

### Q13. What is the role of `max_depth`?  
**A:** Limits how deep each tree can grow. Shallow trees reduce overfitting but may underfit.

---

### Q14. What is the role of `min_samples_split` and `min_samples_leaf`?  
**A:** They control the minimum number of samples required to split a node or be at a leaf node, which regularizes the model and prevents overly complex trees.

---

---

### Q51. What is Random Forest’s assumption?  
**A:** Random Forest assumes that trees are weak learners and that their errors are uncorrelated, making ensemble predictions strong.

---

### Q52. Why does Random Forest perform well in Kaggle competitions?  
**A:** Because it’s robust, requires minimal feature scaling, handles high dimensions, and works well out-of-the-box.

---

### Q53. Do Random Forests require feature scaling?  
**A:** No, since splits are based on thresholds, not distance metrics.

---

### Q54. How does Random Forest deal with multicollinearity?  
**A:** It is less affected due to random feature selection, but correlated features can still reduce diversity.

---

### Q55. What is pruning in Random Forest?  
**A:** Random Forest typically doesn’t prune trees since averaging prevents overfitting. Trees are usually grown to max depth.

---

### Q56. What are OOB samples used for?

---

### Q59. What is the difference between Random Forest and Neural Networks?  
**A:** RF works by ensembling decision trees, while NN uses layers of neurons with weight updates. NNs handle unstructured data better; RFs are better for tabular data.

---

### Q60. Can Random Forest be deployed in real-time applications?  
**A:** Yes, though inference time depends on the number and depth of trees.

---
### Q61. How does Random Forest deal with outliers?  
**A:** Random Forest is robust to outliers because the algorithm averages predictions across multiple trees. Outliers may influence individual trees, but their effect is diluted when combined with others. This reduces sensitivity compared to a single decision tree.

---

### Q62. What is the role of feature randomness in Random Forests?  
**A:** Feature randomness (random feature selection at each split) decorrelates the trees. By ensuring not all trees rely on the same strong predictors, the ensemble captures more diverse patterns and prevents overfitting.

---

### Q63. How does increasing the number of trees affect Random Forest?  
**A:** Increasing the number of trees generally improves performance up to a point, as variance decreases. However, beyond a threshold, performance gains plateau, and computation cost increases unnecessarily.

---

### Q64. What is the computational complexity of training a Random Forest?  
**A:** Complexity is approximately **O(ntrees × nfeatures × nsamples × log(nsamples))**, where `ntrees` is the number of trees. Training is more expensive than a single decision tree but highly parallelizable.

---

### Q65. How does Random Forest handle missing values?  
**A:** Random Forest can handle missing values by using surrogate splits or by averaging predictions from trees that can evaluate samples without requiring all feature values.

---

### Q66. What is the difference between Random Forest and Bagging?  
**A:** Bagging builds trees on bootstrapped samples but uses all features at each split. Random Forest adds feature randomness by selecting a subset of features at each split, which reduces tree correlation and improves generalization.

---

### Q67. Why does Random Forest reduce variance but not bias?  
**A:** Since each decision tree has high variance and low bias, averaging multiple trees reduces variance but the bias remains similar. Random Forest is mainly a variance reduction technique.

---

### Q68. Can Random Forest be used for regression tasks?  
**A:** Yes. In regression, each tree outputs a numerical value, and the final prediction is the average of all tree outputs, reducing variance and improving accuracy.

---

### Q69. How is feature importance measured in Random Forest?  
**A:** Feature importance can be measured using:  
1. **Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI):** How much each feature reduces impurity across splits.  
2. **Mean Decrease in Accuracy (MDA):** Drop in accuracy when the feature values are permuted.

---

### Q70. How do correlated features affect Random Forest?  
**A:** When features are highly correlated, Random Forest may assign higher importance to one while downplaying others. It reduces overall variance but does not fully eliminate correlation issues.

---

### Q71. What are Out-of-Bag (OOB) samples?  
**A:** OOB samples are the ~36.8% of training data not included in a bootstrap sample for a given tree. These are used to evaluate tree performance without needing a separate validation set.

---

### Q72. How is Out-of-Bag error computed?  
**A:** Each sample’s prediction is averaged across all trees where it was OOB. The difference between these aggregated predictions and actual values gives the OOB error estimate, which approximates test error.

---

### Q73. What is the advantage of using OOB error?  
**A:** OOB error provides a built-in unbiased estimate of model performance without needing a separate validation dataset, saving computation and data.

---

### Q74. How does Random Forest prevent overfitting?  
**A:** By averaging predictions of multiple decorrelated trees, Random Forest reduces variance and prevents overfitting, even when individual trees overfit.

---

### Q75. How does Random Forest handle high-dimensional data?  
**A:** Random Forest works well with high-dimensional data because feature selection at each split ensures only subsets of features are considered, making it computationally feasible and reducing overfitting.

---

### Q76. What is the role of bootstrapping in Random Forest?  
**A:** Bootstrapping creates different training sets by sampling with replacement, ensuring diversity among trees and preventing all trees from being identical.

---

### Q77. What is feature bagging in Random Forest?  
**A:** Feature bagging is the process of selecting a random subset of features at each split, ensuring tree diversity and reducing correlation among trees.

---

### Q78. Can Random Forest handle categorical variables?  
**A:** Yes, Random Forest can handle categorical variables by splitting on categories. Some implementations handle them natively, while others require encoding methods like one-hot encoding.

---

### Q79. What are the key hyperparameters in Random Forest?  
**A:**  
- `n_estimators` (number of trees)  
- `max_depth` (maximum tree depth)  
- `min_samples_split`, `min_samples_leaf` (minimum samples per split/leaf)  
- `max_features` (number of features considered at each split)  
- `bootstrap` (whether to use bootstrapping)  

---

### Q80. How does the `max_features` parameter impact Random Forest?  
**A:** A smaller `max_features` increases tree diversity and reduces correlation, improving generalization. A larger value makes trees more similar, reducing randomness but potentially improving individual accuracy.

---

### Q81. What is the difference between ExtraTrees and Random Forest?  
**A:** ExtraTrees (Extremely Randomized Trees) chooses splits randomly rather than searching for the best split. This makes ExtraTrees faster but sometimes less accurate, though it can reduce variance further.

---

### Q82. What happens if we increase `max_depth` in Random Forest?  
**A:** Increasing `max_depth` allows trees to capture more complex patterns, which may increase overfitting for individual trees. However, Random Forest’s averaging usually mitigates this.

---

### Q83. Why is Random Forest considered an ensemble method?  
**A:** Because it combines predictions from multiple decision trees (weak learners) into a single robust prediction, leveraging the “wisdom of the crowd.”

---

### Q84. How does Random Forest differ from Gradient Boosting?  
**A:**  
- Random Forest builds trees independently and averages their results.  
- Gradient Boosting builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects errors of the previous ones.  

---

### Q85. Can Random Forest be parallelized?  
**A:** Yes. Since trees are built independently, Random Forest can be trained in parallel across multiple processors or machines, making it scalable.

---

### Q86. What are limitations of Random Forest?  
**A:**  
- Computationally expensive for large datasets.  
- Difficult to interpret compared to a single decision tree.  
- Struggles with extrapolation in regression.

---

### Q87. How does Random Forest handle class imbalance?  
**A:** Random Forest can handle class imbalance by:  
- Using class weights to penalize minority misclassifications.  
- Resampling techniques (oversampling minority or undersampling majority).  
- Balanced Random Forest variants.  

---

### Q88. What is the difference between Random Forest and Decision Trees in interpretability?  
**A:** Decision Trees are easily interpretable due to their flowchart structure. Random Forest, being an ensemble, is harder to interpret, but feature importance and surrogate models help.

---

### Q89. Can Random Forest overfit?  
**A:** While less likely than single trees, Random Forest can overfit, especially with very deep trees, small datasets, or too many trees without proper tuning.

---

### Q90. What are proximity matrices in Random Forest?  
**A:** A proximity matrix measures similarity between data points based on how often they end up in the same terminal node across trees. Useful for clustering or anomaly detection.

---

### Q91. Can Random Forest be used for anomaly detection?  
**A:** Yes, using proximity matrices or isolation-based approaches. Samples that fall in leaves with very few similar samples can be flagged as anomalies.

---

### Q92. How does Random Forest perform in noisy datasets?  
**A:** Random Forest is robust to noise because averaging across many trees reduces the effect of noisy splits. However, extreme noise can still degrade performance.

---

### Q93. What is the role of randomness in Random Forest?  
**A:** Randomness in bootstrapping and feature selection ensures diversity among trees, which reduces correlation and improves generalization.

---

### Q94. How does the number of features affect Random Forest performance?  
**A:** More features can increase the search space for splits, potentially improving accuracy. However, too many irrelevant features may add noise, requiring careful tuning of `max_features`.

---

### Q95. Why is Random Forest less interpretable than Decision Trees?  
**A:** Because it aggregates predictions from many trees, it’s hard to trace how a single prediction is made. Interpretability relies on global measures like feature importance instead of clear paths.

---

### Q96. How is Random Forest evaluated?  
**A:** Using metrics appropriate for the task:  
- Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.  
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, R².  
- OOB error as an internal validation.  

---

### Q97. What is the bias-variance tradeoff in Random Forest?  
**A:** Random Forest reduces variance by averaging trees while maintaining low bias. It shifts the tradeoff towards lower variance, improving generalization compared to single trees.

---

### Q98. What are some real-world applications of Random Forest?  
**A:**  
- Credit risk modeling  
- Fraud detection  
- Medical diagnosis  
- Customer churn prediction  
- Feature selection in high-dimensional data  

---

### Q99. What are limitations of feature importance in Random Forest?
