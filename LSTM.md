# LSTM Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1. What is an LSTM?
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. It solves the vanishing/exploding gradient problem by introducing gates that regulate information flow.

---

### Q2. Why do we need LSTM instead of simple RNN?
Simple RNNs struggle with long sequences due to vanishing gradients, making it hard to learn long-term dependencies. LSTMs use gates (input, forget, output) and memory cells to retain information over long time spans.

---

### Q3. What are the main components of an LSTM cell?
1. **Cell state** – carries long-term memory.  
2. **Input gate** – decides what new information to store.  
3. **Forget gate** – decides what information to discard.  
4. **Output gate** – controls what part of the memory to output.

---

### Q4. How does the forget gate work in LSTM?
The forget gate takes the previous hidden state and current input, applies a sigmoid activation, and outputs a value between 0 and 1 for each memory cell, determining what portion of past information to retain.

---

### Q5. Explain the input gate in LSTM.
The input gate controls how much new information should enter the cell state. It combines a sigmoid layer (deciding which values to update) with a tanh layer (creating candidate values).

---

### Q6. What is the role of the output gate in LSTM?
The output gate regulates the hidden state (`h_t`). It uses a sigmoid layer to filter the cell state, then applies tanh to scale values between -1 and 1 before producing the final hidden output.

---

### Q7. How does LSTM solve the vanishing gradient problem?
By using **cell states** and **gating mechanisms**, gradients can flow unchanged over many time steps, reducing exponential shrinkage that occurs in traditional RNNs.

---

### Q8. What is the difference between LSTM and GRU?
- **LSTM**: Has 3 gates (input, forget, output) + cell state.  
- **GRU**: Has 2 gates (reset, update), no separate cell state.  
GRUs are simpler and faster but may perform slightly worse on some tasks.

---

### Q9. Where are LSTMs commonly used?
- Language modeling  
- Machine translation  
- Speech recognition  
- Time series forecasting  
- Text generation  
- Video processing

---

### Q10. What is the difference between hidden state and cell state in LSTM?

- **Cell state (c_t)**: Long-term memory, carries information across many time steps.

---

### Q11. Can LSTM handle variable-length sequences?
Yes, LSTM can handle variable-length sequences. In practice, padding and masking are often used to standardize input lengths in batches.

---

### Q12. How does LSTM compare with CNN for sequential data?

Hybrid models (CNN-LSTM) are sometimes used.

---

### Q13. What activation functions are used in LSTM?

3. Cell state is updated with both retained and new information.  

---

### Q22. What is gradient clipping and why is it used in LSTM training?
Gradient clipping limits gradients to a maximum threshold to prevent exploding gradients during backpropagation.

---

---

### Q25. What’s the role of teacher forcing in LSTM training?
Teacher forcing is a training technique where the ground truth at time `t` is used as input at time `t+1` instead of the model’s prediction. Helps faster convergence but may cause exposure bias.

---

### Q26. What is the difference between LSTM and vanilla RNN in terms of equations?
- **RNN**: `h_t = tanh(Wx_t + Uh_{t-1})`
