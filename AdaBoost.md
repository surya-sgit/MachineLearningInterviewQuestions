# AdaBoost Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1. What is AdaBoost?
AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a boosting algorithm that combines multiple weak learners, usually decision stumps, into a strong classifier by adjusting weights on misclassified samples.

---

### Q2. Who introduced AdaBoost?
AdaBoost was introduced by Yoav Freund and Robert Schapire in 1996.

---

### Q3. What does "adaptive" mean in AdaBoost?
"Adaptive" refers to the algorithm’s ability to adapt by focusing more on misclassified samples in each iteration.

---

### Q4. What are weak learners in AdaBoost?
Weak learners are models that perform only slightly better than random guessing, such as decision stumps.

---

### Q5. Why are decision stumps commonly used in AdaBoost?
They are simple, fast to train, and their errors can be effectively corrected by subsequent iterations.

---

### Q6. How does AdaBoost assign weights to samples?
Initially, all samples have equal weights. After each iteration, weights of misclassified samples are increased so the next weak learner focuses more on them.

---

### Q7. What is the role of alpha in AdaBoost?
Alpha is the weight assigned to each weak learner based on its accuracy. More accurate learners get higher alpha.

---

### Q8. How is alpha calculated in AdaBoost?
\[
\alpha = \frac{1}{2} \ln \left( \frac{1 - \epsilon}{\epsilon} \right)
\]
where \( \epsilon \) is the error rate of the weak learner.

---

### Q9. What happens if a weak learner has error > 0.5?
It is discarded, as it performs worse than random guessing.

---

### Q10. How does AdaBoost combine weak learners?
It uses a weighted majority vote for classification and weighted sum for regression.

---

### Q11. What is the loss function in AdaBoost?
It minimizes **exponential loss**, which penalizes misclassified points more heavily.

---

### Q12. How does AdaBoost differ from bagging?
- Bagging: Trains models independently in parallel.  
- AdaBoost: Trains models sequentially, with later models focusing on misclassified samples.

---

### Q13. What is the bias-variance tradeoff in AdaBoost?
AdaBoost reduces both bias and variance, but it can overfit if not regularized.

---

### Q14. Can AdaBoost overfit?
Yes, especially with noisy data or very deep learners.

---

### Q15. How to prevent overfitting in AdaBoost?
- Use weak learners like stumps.

---

### Q16. What is the learning rate in AdaBoost?
A parameter that shrinks the contribution of each weak learner, improving generalization.

---

### Q22. What is AdaBoost.R2?

---

### Q23. How does AdaBoost work in regression?
It assigns higher weights to samples with large prediction errors in each iteration.

---

### Q24. How is sample weight updated in AdaBoost?
\[
w_{i}^{(t+1)} = w_i^{(t)} \cdot e^{\alpha_t \cdot I(y_i \neq h_t(x_i))}
\]

---

### Q25. What does the exponential loss function imply?
It gives higher penalty to misclassified points, forcing the model to focus on them.

---

Any model that performs slightly better than random, but decision stumps are most common.
