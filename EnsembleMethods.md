# Ensemble Methods Interview Questions & Answers

---

### Q1. What are ensemble methods?
Ensemble methods are machine learning techniques that combine multiple models to improve predictive performance, robustness, and generalization compared to individual models.

---

### Q2. Why are ensemble methods effective?
They reduce variance, bias, or improve predictions by aggregating multiple models. The diversity among models is key to their effectiveness.

---

### Q3. What are the main types of ensemble methods?
1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)**
2. **Boosting**
3. **Stacking**
4. **Voting**

---

### Q4. What is bagging?
Bagging trains multiple models on bootstrapped subsets of data and averages their predictions to reduce variance and prevent overfitting.

---

### Q5. What is boosting?
Boosting sequentially trains models, where each new model corrects the mistakes of the previous ones. Examples: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost.

---

### Q6. What is stacking?
Stacking combines predictions from multiple base learners using a meta-learner that learns the optimal way to combine them.

---

### Q7. What is voting in ensembles?
Voting combines predictions from multiple classifiers by majority vote (classification) or averaging (regression).

---

### Q8. What is blending?
Blending is similar to stacking but uses a hold-out validation set instead of cross-validation to train the meta-learner.

---

### Q9. What is the difference between bagging and boosting?
- **Bagging:** Parallel training, reduces variance.
- **Boosting:** Sequential training, reduces bias.

---

### Q10. What is bootstrap sampling?
